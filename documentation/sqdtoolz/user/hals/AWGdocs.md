# AWG Arbitrary Waveform Generation device

This HAL is designed to control AWG and program [Waveforms](./WaveformAWGdocs.md). Additionally, AWGs have marker output which can be used as [Trigger Objects](../misc/TrigPulsedocs.md) for triggering other devices. Unlike UQtools, the pulse library (called WaveformAWG) has been integrate into the stack and has a seperate documentation. This hal device requires reading both Trigger Object documentaion and WavefromAWG documemtation to able to utitlize its entire functionalities.
